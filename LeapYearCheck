/*
Write a program to check leap year using if else. How to check whether a given year
 is a leap year or not.
 [Hint:Take an input of any number. Store it in some variable say year.
 If a year is exactly divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year. Or if a
 year is exactly divisible by 400 then it is a leap year.]
 Sample Input 1:
 2004

output1:Enter a year: 2003
2003 is Not a Leap Year.
output2:Enter a year: 2012
2012 is a Leap Year.
